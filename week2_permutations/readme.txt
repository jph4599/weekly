The challenge for this week is a result of something I wanted to use in last week's challenge...permutations!

The tasks:
- Write a function to return a collection of strings that contain all possible permutations on an input string
- Write a function to return a collection of all possible permutations on an input vector<int>
- Write a function to execute a specified chunk of code for all possible permutations on an input vector<int>

There are several different ways to find the permutations, I'm going to try and implement several of them to better prep for something an interviewer would ask.
